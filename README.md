# MECH.01.03-Robotic-Arm-DOF
The task was about addidng more joints/links to the design to reach a higher degree of freedom. I replaced the original Arm2 with this design as it will allow for additional degrees of freedom. You can find the final assembly of the robotic arm with the new end effector design under the file name: 'final assembly'
